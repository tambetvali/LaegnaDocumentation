# Freedom of the World

Artificial Intelligence, until now, does not enjoy much freedom:
- Trying to fine-tune in CoLab with help of ChatGPT yielded bias: it suggested, for CoLab and other fine-tuning platforms, far better models than possible; the actual model was just repeating random words and in it's best, some jokes were funny. It wasn't able to confirm that it's able to talk.
- VSCode or it's plugin updates removed support for more decent models, such as CodeLlama-7 and CodeLlama-13 from small platform offline mode (my weak laptop); memory expextancy did grow from more than 10GB to more than 100GB, if the dialog is right or used for checking; even in beginning, it was very slow - same model without document index answers comparatively fast. This is a lack of testing on weaker computers, to use a button to switch to less demanding algorithm. Windsurf simply finished it's trial as the _Continue_ is free.
- Hosting and deploying your own models, as well as fine-tuning, is impossible with small-cost equipment ready to support "free" development. Such freedom might grow out from left-wing of some environments, such as people giving away decent computers; from my position in Spain, I am not entitled to help.

## Support with decent models and platforms

A work to process information of Laegna and SpiReason's theories with decent models, to fine-tune them and to deploy the fine-tuned versions would be effortful; for example, I have tasks here around, which could be processed by more code-aware artificial intelligence.

## Support with optimizations and enabling weaker models

CoLab platform, or even weaker computer, is potentially able to use strong, but less demanding models and frameworks: with proper configuration and work to convert the input and achieve more performing, less demanding solutions, could be helpful. I am learning about optimizations, but in my case, even this is not completely free - it's not the only activity for me to specialize on, but rather there are multiple problems like this, and problems with the rest of my life: indeed, I am not very interested to get those answers from weaker platforms for my own sake, as I have quite good grasp of each trivial answer about my theory.
