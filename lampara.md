# Lamp blocks and emphasis of Laegna ecosystem

Where the main theorems are found, and how they relate between texts. Here, theorem or association name is given, with list of materials referring to this theorem.

This was used to generate a system for lower city link on main page - spireason.neocities.org, the lower forward-pointing arrow.

https://spireason.neocities.org/Simply%20about%20Infinities.pdf - the first, most important text for source synchronization.

# Ponegation

Common ponegation: as described throughout texts, Negotion, Negation, Position and Posetion are used instead of True and False (positive and negative).

In these texts, you can see visible mistakes if Ponegate Negation (positive false) and Posetion (negative true) are not there;
this is introduction to laegna from the primitive binary pattern thinking:

- https://spireason.neocities.org/Logecs%20and%20E%20factor%20%E2%80%93%20what%20is%20bad%20in%20positive%20affirmations.pdf

# Ponegation forms

Altough I've not named them - this text could be hard to write without specific names: SpiPo, SpaPo, and ProPo.

Ponegation, always, has the 4 truth values Negotion, Negotion, Position and Posetion, and the values best reflect the same essence into different branches of science, life and religion. They are consistent throughout their use, but not equal in their definitions and methods for that - in each field, this is achieved differently.

# Before ponegation

Laws of Dukkha, imperfection and incompleteness lead to paradox: https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/blob/main/LaeArve/MDLaeMath/MDLaeTheories/index.md (and many other sources you could find).

https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeSpiEssentialTheorems/tree/main/LaegnaTheorems/Ponegation

# SpiPonegation - Life Ponegation

"Spi", here in my texts, most generally means life force.

This is used to measure free-willed, living, desiring systems or systems containing good and bad.

https://spireason.neocities.org/Additional/bizpon - Spiritual/ethical, life Ponegation (good-bad vs. real-illusory)

Good Illusion - Posetion
Good Reality - Position
Illusion of Bad - Negation
Bad Reality - Negotion

# SpaPonegation - Machine and matter ponegation

"Spa", here in my texts and Laegna language, means established environment, which is climbing upwards.

This is used to measure dead processes, material processes and machines.

https://v0-yin-yang-mapping.vercel.app/ - Material/tautological, machine Ponegation (tautological fact vs. tautological fact)

Failing true - Posetion
Lasting true - Position
Failure of false - Negation
"Lasting" false - Negotion

# ProPonegation - Automata ponegation for programmers

"Pro" could mean neglecting in advance, or programming/programmer.

https://spireason.neocities.org/Programming/ - these are two books for programmers.

There, local and github locations of two books are referred - use both.
Book 1: chapter "Tens", page 43, introduces the programmatic ponegation (proponegation).
Book 2: chapter "Frequential Logex", as well as other chapters, guide to implementation of proponegation.
